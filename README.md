# Imposter Game

This is a simple implementation of the Imposter Game, where users can join a room and each user (except for 1 or 2) gets the same question, meanwhile all the other users get a different question. Based on the answers, those who got the question must find out who the imposter is.

Can it be better? Yes.

Does it work and did GenAI make most of this? Yes.
